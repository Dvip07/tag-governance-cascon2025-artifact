# 📜 Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## 🛠️  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** – The summary must be **≤ 40% of the original character count or ≤ 400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** – **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** – HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., “Design `POST /users/signup` endpoint”). Vague entries like “Do stuff” are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** – Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X–Y"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** – If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** – Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** – Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## 🔹 Step 1 – Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules 1–7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## 🔹 Step 2 – HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10–13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-003-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

# Requirement req-003 (FinTech)

FT-003: Fraud Alert for Micro-Transactions
Title:
Automated Fraud Alert Trigger for Micro-Transactions

Background & Objective:
Emerging fraud patterns increasingly involve micro-transactions (transactions under $1), which may bypass conventional alert thresholds. To protect customers and improve fraud detection, an automated system must be developed to flag and notify relevant teams when suspicious patterns involving micro-transactions are detected.

Requirement Details:

Detection Logic:

Implement configurable rules to identify patterns of multiple micro-transactions originating from the same customer or device within a short time window (default: 24 hours).

Allow rules to be refined based on transaction frequency, merchant type, and time of day.

Alerting & Notification:

Upon detection, generate real-time alerts to the Fraud Operations team via existing channels (Slack, email, dashboard widget).

Each alert should include transaction details, customer ID, merchant info, and rule(s) triggered.

Edge Case Handling:

False positives (e.g., app store micropayments, legitimate donations) must be logged and used to continuously update and improve detection rules.

System must prevent alert spam by rate-limiting notifications per customer.

Audit & Reporting:

Maintain detailed logs of all triggered alerts, investigations, and their outcomes.

Provide periodic summary reports for compliance and risk review.

Security & Privacy:

Ensure no sensitive customer data is exposed in alert payloads beyond what is necessary for investigation.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must integrate with existing fraud monitoring systems and alerting infrastructure.

Initial ruleset must be reviewed and signed off by Risk and Compliance before go-live.
