# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-013-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

# Requirement req-013 (FinTech)

FT-013: Batch Payouts to Sellers with Failure Rollback Tracking
Title:
Implementation of Batch Payout Processing for Marketplace Sellers With Transaction Failure Rollback and Audit

Background & Objective:
As marketplace volume grows, seller payout operations increasingly involve large-scale batch processing. To minimize manual interventions and payment errors, we require a robust batch payout engine that supports partial and complete rollback in case of transaction failures. This will ensure trust with sellers, simplify reconciliation, and maintain compliance with payment regulations.

Scope of Requirement:

Batch Processing Logic:

Develop a batch payout engine to initiate, track, and reconcile payouts to multiple sellers in a single operation.

Each batch must log all component transactions with unique IDs and metadata (seller ID, amount, method, status).

Support scheduled and on-demand batch payouts, with configurability for batch size, currency, and payout window.

Failure Handling & Rollback:

If any transaction within a batch fails (e.g., bank error, insufficient funds, compliance hold), provide options for:

Rolling back the entire batch

Re-attempting only failed transactions

Marking partial successes and logging exceptions

All rollback actions must maintain atomicity‚Äîno ‚Äústranded‚Äù funds.

Audit Trail & Reporting:

Record detailed logs for all batch operations, transaction attempts, rollbacks, and manual overrides.

Generate exception and summary reports for finance, support, and compliance teams.

Provide an admin dashboard to view batch status, drill down into individual payouts, and initiate rollback or retry actions.

Notifications & Communication:

Notify sellers of payout status (success, partial, failed) via email, in-app, and/or SMS, with detailed reason codes for failures.

If a payout is rolled back, inform affected sellers and provide clear next steps or rescheduling info.

Compliance & Security:

Ensure compliance with financial regulations (e.g., AML, KYC, local banking rules).

Log all data changes and restrict sensitive operations to authorized personnel.

Support audit export and data retention per compliance requirements.

Edge Case Handling:

Handle mixed-currency payouts and split payments (single seller, multiple bank accounts).

In the event of a systemic processor outage, pause all new batch payouts and notify admin users.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires integration with payment processors and internal seller management systems.

Rollback operations must not impact system performance during peak payout cycles.

Deliverables:

Batch payout engine & admin UI

Exception reporting tools

Audit and notification logic

Documentation and training guides
