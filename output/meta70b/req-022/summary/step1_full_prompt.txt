# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-022-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

# Requirement req-022 (SaaS)

SA-007: Per-Resource Access Logs With Compliance Role Export
Title:
Add Per-Resource Access Logs, Exportable by Compliance and Security Roles

Background:
Certain customers in regulated industries need granular logs showing who accessed each file, record, or dashboard. We need to support detailed export and reporting.

Requirements:

Logging:

For every access to a key resource, log user ID, timestamp, IP, access type (read, edit, export), and context (via API, UI, etc.).

Store logs for at least 1 year (configurable).

Export Controls:

Allow users with ‚ÄúCompliance‚Äù or ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù roles to export logs for selected resources in CSV or JSON.

Apply filters by date, user, or resource type.

Edge Cases:

Mask sensitive data (e.g., user emails) on export if required by company or jurisdiction policy.

If a user‚Äôs role changes after accessing a resource, keep the original access context in the log.

Notifications:

Notify compliance team leads of large-volume exports or unusual access patterns.

Docs & Support:

Update admin docs and compliance playbooks with export and retention guidelines.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Log exports must be rate-limited to prevent abuse.

Must meet data protection and privacy requirements per client‚Äôs geography.
