# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-014-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

# Requirement req-014 (FinTech)

FT-014: Blockchain Wallet Gas-Fee Estimation Pre-Transaction
Title:
Add Pre-Transaction Gas-Fee Estimation for Blockchain Wallet Users

Background & Objective:
To enhance transparency and usability for blockchain wallet users, the platform must provide gas-fee estimation prior to transaction confirmation. This feature reduces failed transactions, improves user trust, and is crucial as blockchain network congestion and gas price volatility impact transaction cost and timing.

Scope of Requirement:

Fee Estimation Logic:

Integrate with blockchain explorers and fee oracles to retrieve real-time gas fee estimates for supported networks (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).

Show a range (min/expected/max) and update estimates dynamically if user delays confirmation.

Include estimation for various transaction types: simple transfers, contract calls, token swaps, etc.

User Experience & UI:

Display the estimated gas fee and the total transaction cost (including network fees) before user confirmation.

Offer advanced users an option to adjust gas parameters (e.g., price, limit) with inline guidance.

If fee spikes occur due to pending transaction pool congestion, highlight this with warnings and advice.

Edge Case & Error Handling:

For networks experiencing instability or delayed fee data, communicate potential inaccuracy and suggest waiting or retry.

If the gas-fee estimate cannot be retrieved, disable transaction confirmation until resolved.

Security & Compliance:

Ensure all user data and transaction parameters are securely handled in compliance with privacy and security policies.

Log all fee queries and confirmations for future troubleshooting and audit.

Notifications & Support:

Provide help documentation explaining gas fees and troubleshooting steps for failed or stuck transactions.

Offer customer support a summary log of recent estimates and user actions.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must support fee estimation for at least three networks at launch.

No impact on transaction signing or security logic.

Deliverables:

Updated wallet UI and backend logic

Fee oracle integration modules

Support documentation and FAQ updates

Audit and monitoring scripts
```
