# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-017-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

SA-002: Prorated Plan Upgrades With Billing History Preservation
Title:
Implement Prorated Upgrades for Subscription Plans While Retaining Accurate Billing History

Background:
Customers expect to upgrade their plans at any time and only pay for what they use. We need to support mid-cycle plan upgrades and handle the resulting billing and reporting cleanly.

Requirements:

Upgrade Logic:

When a user upgrades mid-cycle (e.g., from Basic to Pro), calculate the unused value of their current plan and apply it as a credit toward the new plan.

The upgrade takes effect immediately, but the billing cycle aligns with the original renewal date.

Billing & History:

Record all upgrade events, credits, and charges in the customer‚Äôs billing history.

Ensure invoices show a clear breakdown (old plan refund/credit, new plan charge, taxes).

Edge Cases:

Handle upgrades involving both monthly and annual plans, including overlapping dates.

If a customer downgrades during the same cycle, flag for manual review (to prevent abuse).

Notifications:

Email users a summary of the upgrade, showing calculations, credits, and new renewal date.

Notify admins of any unusual upgrade/downgrade patterns.

Support & Docs:

Update support scripts and customer FAQs to cover common upgrade scenarios and ‚Äúwhat happens if‚Ä¶‚Äù questions.

Dependencies & Constraints:

May require updates to payment processor integrations.

Must support local taxes/VAT in all calculations.
