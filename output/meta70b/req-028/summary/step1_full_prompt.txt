# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-028-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

SA-013: Sentiment- and Urgency-Based Ticket Routing for Helpdesk
Title:
AI-Driven Sentiment and Urgency Classification for Intelligent Ticket Routing in Helpdesk

Strategic Value:
To drive operational efficiency and empower support teams, we need to infuse our helpdesk with AI-powered sentiment and urgency detection. By auto-classifying incoming tickets, we can route high-priority or emotionally negative cases to senior agents, accelerating resolution and enhancing the customer experience. This lays the foundation for scalable, proactive support operations.

Requirements:

NLP Sentiment Engine:

Integrate a sentiment analysis model to classify tickets as positive, neutral, or negative upon receipt.

Fine-tune urgency detection to flag language indicating immediate action is required (e.g., ‚Äúcan‚Äôt log in,‚Äù ‚Äúcritical outage‚Äù).

Routing Logic:

Auto-route negative or urgent tickets to senior agents or escalation queues.

Route routine inquiries to self-service or standard agent pools.

Reporting & Feedback:

Track resolution time and customer satisfaction for each sentiment/urgency class.

Surface trends (e.g., spike in negative tickets after release) for product/ops review.

Edge Cases:

Detect and handle sarcasm or ambiguous tone using secondary cues (e.g., ticket history, emoji analysis).

Allow agents to reclassify sentiment/urgency if model is incorrect, feeding back into continuous learning.

Compliance & Transparency:

Log all classification decisions and routing actions for audit and improvement.

Allow users to opt out of automated sentiment classification in settings.

Documentation:

Publish guidelines for agents on interpreting and correcting sentiment/urgency scores.

Update customer help content to explain AI-driven routing.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must not delay ticket processing by more than 500ms per ticket.

Requires buy-in from support leadership and training for teams.

KPIs:

Average resolution time for negative/urgent tickets down 30%

85% model accuracy on labeled training set

90% agent satisfaction with routing recommendations
