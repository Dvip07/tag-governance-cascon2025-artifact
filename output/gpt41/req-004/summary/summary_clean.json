  "requirement_id": "REQ-004",
  "summary": "This requirement mandates an upgrade of the audit log infrastructure to achieve full GDPR v2 right-to-erasure (RtE) compliance. The system must support both complete and partial deletion/redaction of user-related log entries, with comprehensive user-mapping via new metadata fields and log data classification (personal vs. operational). All deletion/redaction actions must be secure, tamper-evident, and logged with detailed meta-logs, requiring cryptographic validation and hash chaining. The solution must handle edge cases (e.g., composite entries, legal retention exceptions), include APIs for compliance team review/approval, and enforce access controls. Real-time monitoring, dashboarding, and comprehensive operational reporting are required, alongside rigorous testing for privacy and retention edge cases. The solution must preserve audit log system performance, undergo legal/security/compliance sign-off, and deliver updated schemas, APIs, documentation, and compliance validation."
