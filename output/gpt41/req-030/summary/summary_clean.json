  "requirement_id": "REQ-030",
  "summary": "Automate UI regression tests in the staging environment on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers, integrating with the CI/CD pipeline to block deployments if critical tests fail. Provide real-time browser/platform/screen-size coverage analytics with visualized gaps. Collect full logs, screenshots, and videos for failed cases, and summarize flakiness trends with stabilization recommendations. Detect flaky tests only in headless mode and flag for review; allow QA to quarantine unrepeatable failures with notification instead of blocking deployments. Maintain updated testing/triage guides, and share browser support matrices. Secure test artifacts, restrict access to authorized personnel, and enforce accessibility (WCAG) compliance. Limit added CI/CD build time to 10 minutes. KPIs: 99% coverage, <5% flake rate, <12hr bug fix time. Depend on cloud-based browser farm infrastructure."
