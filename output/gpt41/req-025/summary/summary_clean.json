  "summary": "This requirement mandates granular, real-time performance analytics for all dashboard widgets (first- and third-party) in a SaaS platform. Key functional needs include: instrumenting widgets to capture load, render, and interactive readiness times; reporting per widget, user, device, and browser; providing engineering dashboards with breakdowns and root-cause drilldowns; automated alerting for SLA breaches (e.g., 95th percentile >2s); CI/CD integration to prevent performance regressions; edge-case handling for external services and user prompt if dashboard is slow; anonymized telemetry data adhering to privacy agreements with user opt-out and transparency; self-service analytics for product owners; and comprehensive documentation. Non-functional requirements: no analytics degradation of dashboard performance, compliance with privacy standards, and the following KPIs: 99% dashboards loading <2.5s, <0.5% widget-level error rate, and regression fixes in 48h. Upgrade to telemetry infrastructure is a dependency."
