  "requirement_id": "REQ-016",
  "summary": "Implement dynamic, role-based enforcement of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), mandating it for Admin, Finance, and DevOps roles, while allowing optional use for User and Viewer roles. Policies must update immediately upon any role change. Mobile app users are temporarily exempt from mandatory 2FA due to unsupported 2FA functionality; web and desktop apps must always enforce 2FA. Users must be notified of enforcement and receive clear setup instructions at login, with tailored notifications for unsupported channels. The system must track and log policy exceptions and generate reports showing users not in compliance or officially exempted. Help documentation and admin guides should be updated accordingly. Coordination with the mobile development team is required for eventual mobile 2FA support, with a strict constraint that existing users cannot be locked out during migration. Non-functional aspects addressed include security, usability, maintainability, and compliance."
