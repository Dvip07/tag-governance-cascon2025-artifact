  "summary": "Implement a webhook-based notification system for insurance API claim status changes (submitted, in review, approved, rejected, paid). Clients must be able to register endpoints, select events, and define custom data fields per integration profile. The system must validate custom fields (check for reserved word conflicts, naming/type constraints), enforce endpoint verification (shared secret/signed payloads), and support managing webhook registrations via a portal. Reliability is ensured via retry with exponential backoff, delivery logs/status (API/dashboard), and notification on persistent failures. Edge cases include schema conflicts (reject with detailed errors) and rate limiting for high-frequency clients. Non-functionals: scale for enterprise event volume, maintain compliance with thorough logging, and provide usability features like sample payloads, setup docs, and support team training. Dependencies include upgrades to core claims processing and API."
