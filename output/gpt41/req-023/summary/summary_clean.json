  "summary": "This requirement mandates a scalable feature flag system enabling geo-targeted, progressive rollout of platform features, using real-time Geo-IP segmentation at country, region, and city level. Admins must control flags from a portal, enabling percentage-based and dynamic rollouts, with immediate global effect. Integration with real-time analytics is required to monitor adoption, error rates, and conversion KPIs by geography and cohort, with dashboards and automated alerts for negative impacts like error spikes. One-click rollback with instant system-wide effect and full traceability is mandatory. User experience needs include notification of staged or beta participation, opt-out options, and compliance with regional data privacy laws (GDPR/CCPA). The system must robustly handle users with ambiguous or mismatched geo-data, support audit trails, and create comprehensive documentation for product and developer enablement. Dependencies include location-aware authentication/session services and BI integration. KPIs: rollback under 30 seconds, rollout error rate below 0.2%, and adoption per geo-segment measured within 72 hours."
