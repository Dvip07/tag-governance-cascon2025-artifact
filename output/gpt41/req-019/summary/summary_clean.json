  "requirement_id": "REQ-019",
  "summary": "Enable SaaS product teams to perform cohort analysis with time-decaying weighting for user retention metrics. Users can create and auto-update custom cohorts based on signup date, product usage events, or milestones. Retention/activity metrics should support adjustable time-decay functions (e.g., exponential, linear), with UI controls for function selection. Visualizations must include trend lines and heatmaps, supporting overlay of standard vs. time-decayed metrics, and support CSV/PDF export. Handle users in overlapping cohorts, and prompt users when decay settings zero out metrics. Provide documentation on cohort logic, decay weighting, and best practices. The solution must integrate with the current analytics data store and not increase dashboard load times by more than 20%."
