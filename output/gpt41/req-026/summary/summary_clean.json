  "summary": "REQ-026 defines a behaviorally intelligent NPS feedback system for a SaaS product. The system auto-triggers NPS surveys based on configurable user behaviors (e.g., after onboarding, five logins, key feature adoption), with logic to delay or suppress prompts if churn risk is detected. NPS surveys will be natively embedded in web/mobile apps to minimize workflow disruption, include suppression and retry rules after dismissals, and coordinate across devices to avoid duplicate prompts. Analytics must visualize response rates and trends by cohort and event, and NPS data must integrate with CRM/support workflows. Compliance with privacy regulations is required, including auditability and user opt-outs. Edge cases cover conflicting triggers and multi-device users. Documentation and enablement updates for teams are mandated, as is a team feedback loop to refine rules. Integration with analytics, CRM, and support platforms is required, surveys must be localized, and KPIs specify survey response rates (>20%), NPS mapping, and fast follow-up (<24h)."
