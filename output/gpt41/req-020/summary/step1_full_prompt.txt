# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-020-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

SA-005: CRM Contact Sync With Duplicate Merge Rules
Title:
Sync Contacts From Third-Party CRMs With Duplicate Merge Handling

Background:
Many customers connect their Salesforce, HubSpot, or other CRM accounts to sync contacts. We need to handle duplicate detection and merge logic in a user-friendly way.

Requirements:

Sync & Import:

Support one-click sync with major CRMs via OAuth and API keys.

On initial sync, import all contacts, with a dry run showing potential duplicates before merging.

Duplicate Detection & Merge:

Use configurable rules (e.g., email match, phone match, fuzzy name) to flag duplicates.

Allow users to review and resolve matches: ‚Äúmerge,‚Äù ‚Äúkeep separate,‚Äù or ‚Äúignore.‚Äù

If conflicting data exists, show a side-by-side diff and let users pick field values to keep.

Ongoing Sync:

Automatically merge new duplicates based on saved preferences.

Log all merges and changes, showing a history per contact.

Edge Cases:

If a merge would create conflicting webhook updates, warn the user and pause the sync.

Support rollback for accidental merges within 24 hours.

Docs & Support:

Update onboarding guide for CRM sync and duplicate management.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must respect API rate limits for each CRM provider.

Merge logic must not disrupt existing contact-linked workflows.
