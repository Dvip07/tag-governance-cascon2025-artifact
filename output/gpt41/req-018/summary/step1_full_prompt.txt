# 📜 Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## 🛠️  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** – The summary must be **≤ 40% of the original character count or ≤ 400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** – **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** – HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., “Design `POST /users/signup` endpoint”). Vague entries like “Do stuff” are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** – Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X–Y"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** – If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** – Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** – Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## 🔹 Step 1 – Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules 1–7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## 🔹 Step 2 – HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10–13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-018-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

# Requirement req-018 (SaaS)

SA-003: Shared Inbox With Tagging and Assignment Rules
Title:
Develop Shared Team Inbox With Tag-Based Routing and Reply Assignment

Background:
Support and sales teams handle high volumes of incoming emails. To avoid confusion and duplicate work, we need a shared inbox with smart assignment features and tagging.

Requirements:

Inbox Design:

Build a shared inbox where team members can see, tag, and assign emails.

Allow multiple tags per email (e.g., “Urgent,” “Billing,” “Feature Request”).

Assignment Rules:

Enable rules for automatic assignment (e.g., all “Billing” tagged emails go to the finance team).

Support manual reassignment and marking as “unassigned.”

Collision Handling:

Prevent multiple users from replying to the same email at once; lock or warn if someone else is drafting a response.

If a reply is sent, mark the email as “handled” and notify others.

Search & Reporting:

Provide filters/search by tag, assignment, and status.

Generate reports showing response times, volume by tag, and team workload.

Edge Cases:

If two agents try to assign themselves at the same time, resolve with a simple “first come, first served” rule and alert both.

If a tag is removed that affects an assignment rule, prompt to reassign or unassign as needed.

Docs & Support:

Document the tagging and assignment logic for onboarding and support.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must integrate with existing email systems (IMAP, Gmail, O365).

Changes must not disrupt current workflows for teams not using the shared inbox.
```

**Respond only with text enclosed by the fences above. Do not include any extra commentary or explanation. If information is missing or ambiguous, use `"unknown"` for the value.**
