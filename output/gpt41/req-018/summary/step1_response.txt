### === SUMMARY START ===

{
  "requirement_id": "REQ-018",
  "summary": "Design and implement a shared team inbox for support and sales teams, allowing members to view, tag (multiple tags per email), and assign incoming emails. Enable automatic assignment rules based on tags (e.g., 'Billing' emails to finance), with manual reassignment and an 'unassigned' status supported. Prevent concurrent replies to the same email by locking or warning users; mark emails as 'handled' upon reply and notify the team. Provide filters and search by tag, assignment, and status, plus generate reports on response times, email volume by tag, and workload. Handle edge cases, such as simultaneous self-assignment (resolved by first-come, first-served and alert), and tag removals that affect assignment (prompt for reassignment/unassignment). Document all tagging/assignment logic for onboarding and support. Must integrate with IMAP, Gmail, O365, and not disrupt existing team workflows not adopting the shared inbox. Non-functional requirements include system reliability, scalability, maintainability, and minimal workflow disruption."
