  "summary": "Enable users to add inline, threaded comments directly within uploaded PDFs, supporting at least two nesting levels for replies. Users must be able to highlight text or click to start threads, distinguishing unresolved and resolved comments with filters. Notifications\u2014including direct links\u2014shall be sent to document owners and participants when comments or threads are added, replied to, or resolved. Upon PDF version updates, the system should attempt to preserve comment positions or warn of shifts; overlapping/duplicate highlights must be prevented. The feature must support major browsers and PDF viewers, handle large PDFs (100+ pages) without performance degradation, and include a quickstart guide and feedback best practices. Non-functional focus: performance, usability, and compatibility."
