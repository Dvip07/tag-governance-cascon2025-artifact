  "requirement_id": "REQ-029",
  "summary": "Implement audit log enhancements to record every user action with timestamp, resource, session ID, and *role at action time*. Accurately track role changes within user sessions and ensure logs retain historical role context, even if roles shift mid-session. Build a query interface for compliance/admin users, supporting advanced filters by role, resource, and action type. Maintain session-consistent role information for auditability, flag anomalous or rapid role switches, and allow export of logs in CSV, JSON, and PDF formats, including compliance headers and digital signatures. Generate automated reports by role, update documentation and training, and ensure storage meets SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA standards. System should offer <2s average query for 12 months, full traceability, and no compliance gaps, handling edge cases such as deleted/orphaned users. Backend schema and session logic upgrades may be needed; export must handle high-volume data."
