# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-029-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

# Requirement req-029 (SaaS)

SA-014: Role-Based Audit Log Querying With Session Consistency
Title:
Enhanced Audit Log Querying by User Role With Session State Consistency

Strategic Impact:
Supporting customers with strict regulatory needs requires granular, auditable log access‚Äînot just by username, but by role context at time of action. This feature will elevate our compliance offering, streamlining internal investigations and providing traceability for clients in finance, healthcare, and the public sector.

Requirements:

Granular Log Data:

Log every user action with timestamp, resource, session ID, and role (at that moment).

Retain role changes within session, ensuring accurate historical context even if roles shift mid-session.

Role-Based Query Interface:

Enable compliance and admin users to query audit logs by role, resource, and action type.

Provide advanced filters (e.g., ‚Äúshow all edits by anyone in Finance last month‚Äù).

Session Consistency Handling:

If a user changes roles within a single session, maintain a clear timeline of each role for each action.

Flag anomalous or rapid role switching for investigation.

Reporting & Export:

Allow exports in CSV, JSON, and PDF, with compliance headers and digital signatures.

Provide automated weekly/monthly summaries by role.

Edge Cases:

For deleted users or orphaned actions, maintain logs with anonymized IDs and original role context.

Ensure log storage meets retention and security standards (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA).

Docs & Training:

Update compliance manuals and onboarding for audit log best practices.

Dependencies & Constraints:

May require backend schema changes and session management upgrades.

Export functionality must support high-volume logs.

KPIs:

<2s average query response for 12 months of logs

100% traceability of role context per action

Zero compliance violations due to audit log gaps
```
