  "summary": "This requirement mandates building a secure, user-friendly feature enabling users to freeze or unfreeze eligible virtual debit and credit cards through the mobile app in real time. The UI must display card status with clear feedback, handle failed operations with retries, and offer contextual help. Backend services must provide atomic, idempotent RESTful endpoints, ensure instant status sync across all systems, handle exceptions (recurring transactions), and robustly log all actions for auditing. Requests during maintenance must be queued and user-notified; failures at third parties must roll back and inform users. Strong authentication (biometrics, PIN, MFA), encryption of communications and logs, and compliance with PCI DSS and SOC 2 are required. Customer support tools and notifications must be updated. User guides and help content must be revised, and the rollout should include a pilot phase and feedback loop. Dependencies include integration with card processors and transaction authorization, state rollback for failed ops, and adherence to current performance standards."
