  "requirement_id": "REQ-027",
  "summary": "This requirement mandates comprehensive RTL (Right-to-Left) layout and mirrored UI support within the SaaS Visual Builder to enable regionally compliant, fully mirrored UIs for global and emerging market users. The core includes development of an RTL engine toggling layout properties (flex, grid, positioning), accurate rendering for all components, and designer tools for instant LTR/RTL preview with per-section/component overrides. Integration with translation memory, locale-specific formatting, and edge-case handling (flagging/remediating broken components) are required. Validations ensure accessibility/compliance (WCAG, ADA), while audit logs provide transparency. Documentation updates (guides, onboarding) and enablement (webinars) are included. Dependencies involve third-party vendors, and regressions affecting LTR performance/accessibility must be prevented. KPIs: 95% RTL compatibility, RTL pages published in <2x LTR time, and 20% customer satisfaction increase in targeted regions."
