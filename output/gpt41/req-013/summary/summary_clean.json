  "requirement_id": "REQ-013",
  "summary": "Build a robust batch payout engine for marketplace sellers that supports both scheduled and on-demand payouts, detailed transaction tracking, and failure handling with partial or complete rollback. All batch operations must log transaction details (IDs, metadata) and support configuration of batch size, currency, and payout timing. In case of any transaction failure (e.g., bank error, compliance hold), provide atomic rollback for entire batches or allow retrying failed transactions, while recording exceptions and maintaining audit trails. The solution includes an admin dashboard for monitoring, rollback, and reporting; automated notifications to sellers (email, in-app, SMS) with reasons for failures; compliance enforcement (AML, KYC, audit logging, access control); support for mixed currencies, split payments, and outage handling; performance and security safeguards; and integration with payment processors and internal seller systems. Deliverables cover the payout engine, admin UI, exception/audit logic, and documentation."
