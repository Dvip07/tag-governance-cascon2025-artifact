  "requirement_id": "REQ-010",
  "summary": "Design and implement a dual-ledger system for financial transactions, introducing both an operational ledger (real-time posting, holds, phantom balances) and a reporting ledger (regulatory, reporting, reconciliation). All transactions must be posted to both ledgers and linked via metadata. Phantom (pending or temporary) balances require lifecycle logic (creation, update, expiry, conversion or reversal) and must be immediately visible in UIs and internal dashboards. Build automated and manual reconciliation tools to resolve mismatches, with immutable audit trails, role-based access, compliance to SOX/PCI-DSS, and exception handling for edge cases like phantom reversals and batch failures. Ensure support for multi-currency, including conversion logic. Provide full testing, monitoring, updated APIs, batch jobs, exception dashboards, and documentation. Phased migration from single-ledger legacy systems may be needed, and posting performance overhead must stay within 10%. All changes require sign-off from Finance, Risk, and Compliance."
