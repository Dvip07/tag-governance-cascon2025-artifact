  "requirement_id": "REQ-012",
  "summary": "REQ-012 requires the design and implementation of a GST calculation and reporting module for B2B SaaS platforms expanding into Canadian provinces. The system must dynamically manage provincial tax rates (including dual-tax provinces), update with government changes, handle edge cases like tax exemptions, ambiguous addresses, and retroactive rate adjustments, and maintain audit logs. Accurate GST application is required for each invoice based on billing address, service location, and exemptions, with line-item breakdowns for federal and provincial portions. Reporting must support province-level GST summaries, both accrual and cash accounting, exportable audit-ready data, and reconciliation tools. All user and transaction data must comply with PIPEDA/GDPR, with strict role-based access for configuration/reporting features. Dependencies include integration with tax rate APIs and coordination with Finance, Legal, and Support teams. Deliverables: upgraded billing/invoice modules, tax rate management UI, reporting/export tools, documentation, and compliance logs."
