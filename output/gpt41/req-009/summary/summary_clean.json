  "summary": "Implement a scheduled cross-border payments feature enabling users to lock foreign exchange (FX) rates for a defined window (e.g., 24 hours), ensuring price certainty for future transactions. Enhance the payments UI to allow scheduling, FX rate previews, locking actions, expiry visuals, and countdowns. Integrate with external FX rate providers for real-time quotes and locking commitments; record all rate locks with audit metadata. Payment logic must handle rate expiry, user funding failures, and enable pre-execution cancellations with appropriate refund, notification, and compliance controls. Build mechanisms to prevent abuse of rate locks (e.g., speculative cancelling), support regulatory documentation for large-value transfers, and maintain complete audit logs. Notify users at all key stages (confirmation, reminders, expiry) via multiple channels, and provide dashboards for finance/compliance monitoring. Support edge cases such as FX provider outages and insufficient user balances. Dependencies include FX provider contracts, stable APIs, and ensuring payment processing SLAs/regulatory timelines remain unaffected. The feature will launch as a limited beta before general release, with user and support documentation and a structured feedback process."
