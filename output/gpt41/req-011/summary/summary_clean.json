  "summary": "REQ-011 requires implementing dynamic EMI (Equated Monthly Installments) options at checkout, personalized in real time based on each customer\u2019s creditworthiness via integration with both internal and third-party credit bureaus. The system must assess eligibility and present EMI plans (varying tenure/interest rates) within 2 seconds, showing only qualified options. For borderline cases, support staff can override with justification. Failure or timeout in credit lookup triggers default conservative EMI and post-settlement flagging. User transparency, EMI calculators, and clear communication of all terms and dispute processes are mandated. Full compliance with lending/privacy laws (e.g., FCRA, GDPR), user consent, and auditable logging are required. Monitoring adoption rates, analytics for Product/Risk, and review logs are in scope. Dependencies include agreements with bureaus, Product/Legal/Compliance checkpoint for EMI logic changes, and checkout UI/back-end updates."
