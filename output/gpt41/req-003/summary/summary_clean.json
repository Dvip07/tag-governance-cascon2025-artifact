  "summary": "Develop an automated fraud alert system targeting micro-transactions (transactions <$1) to address evolving fraud patterns not caught by standard thresholds. The system must support configurable rules (based on transaction frequency, merchant type, device, customer, and time), triggering real-time alerts to the Fraud Operations team via Slack, email, and dashboard upon suspicious detection. Alerts require contextual transaction, customer, merchant, and triggered rule details. Prevent alert flooding by rate-limiting per customer. false positives (e.g., app store micropayments, donations) must be logged for rule refinement, with all alerts, investigations, and outcomes audited. Periodic summary reports should be generated for compliance/risk review. Enforce privacy by limiting sensitive data exposure in alerts. Integrate with existing fraud monitoring/alert infrastructure, with the initial ruleset to be risk/compliance-approved pre-launch. Key non-functional aspects: security, compliance, auditability, usability, maintainability, and availability."
