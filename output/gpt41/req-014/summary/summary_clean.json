  "summary": "This requirement mandates integrating a real-time gas-fee estimation feature into blockchain wallet platforms. Before confirming a transaction, users must see a range of estimated gas fees (min/expected/max) for different transaction types across at least three supported blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Polygon. Estimates should update dynamically, with the UI displaying the fee and total cost; users can adjust gas parameters with guidance. System must handle network disruptions by warning users of inaccuracies or disabling confirmations if estimates fail. All user data and transaction parameters must be secured and compliant with privacy policies. Logging of fee queries and confirmations is required for auditing and support. User support features must include documentation of gas fees/troubleshooting and provide support staff with recent estimate and user action logs. Deliverables include updated wallet UI, backend logic, fee oracle integrations, documentation, and audit/monitoring scripts. Performance, usability, security, compliance, and maintainability are prioritized."
