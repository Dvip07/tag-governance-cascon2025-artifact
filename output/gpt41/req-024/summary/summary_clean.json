  "summary": "REQ-024 defines a unified notification engine for SaaS, supporting template-driven messaging over email, SMS, push, and in-app channels. Features include centralized templates with dynamic fields and multi-language support, flexible scheduling with per-user timezone delays, and automatic channel selection based on user preferences and delivery history. The personalization engine leverages user profile and behavior data for tailored content and timing, supports A/B testing, and automates audience segmentation. Real-time analytics dashboards cover open, click, and conversion rates, while alerts and fallback mechanisms address drop-off and deliverability. Compliance is ensured with opt-out options and adherence to CAN-SPAM, CASL, and GDPR, tracking all opt-outs and failures. Edge cases like night-time delivery and duplicate suppression are handled. The solution integrates with current infrastructure, adapts to timezones, and includes documentation for marketers and engineers. KPIs: 25% open rate, <1% failed delivery, 10% post-campaign activation increase."
