# üìú Strict HLJ Summary & Structure Planning Prompt (Upgraded JSON Version)

> **Parameter:** `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 10`

You are a **software-requirements architect** tasked with analyzing a complex stakeholder document and planning its conversion into **High-Level JSON (HLJ)** items.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è  Global Hard Rules

1. **Length cap** ‚Äì The summary must be **‚â§‚ÄØ40% of the original character count or ‚â§‚ÄØ400 tokens**, whichever is *smaller*.
2. **Fence markers** ‚Äì **Wrap each section with the exact regex-friendly fences below.** *Do not alter them.*
3. **Atomicity** ‚Äì HLJ preview items must describe *one* clear action/output (e.g., ‚ÄúDesign `POST /users/signup` endpoint‚Äù). Vague entries like ‚ÄúDo stuff‚Äù are forbidden.
4. **Line-number provenance** ‚Äì Include source line/paragraph numbers in `"line_source": "Ln X‚ÄìY"`. If the source span is unclear, use `"line_source": "(unknown)"`.
5. **Fail-loud quota** ‚Äì If you cannot meet any numeric constraint or required field, output the token `!!CONSTRAINT_BROKEN!!` at the end of the relevant section.
6. **Hallucination flag** ‚Äì Any feature or detail *not* found in the raw text must be prefixed with `[EXTRA]`.
7. **Non-functional checklist** ‚Äì Explicitly check for and preserve cues about **performance, security, scalability, usability, compliance/regulation, availability, maintainability** as appropriate.

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì Summary Generation

Generate a **structured, developer-friendly summary** that respects Rules‚ÄØ1‚Äì7.
*Preserve all functional & non-functional aspects, dates, deadlines, dependencies, regulations, stakeholder priorities, and critical terminology.*

---

## üîπ Step‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì HLJ Structure Planning (JSON Format)

* **Do *not* generate full HLJs yet.**
* Estimate the **total number of atomic HLJ items**.
* If the count exceeds `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`, split the preview list into sequential **chunks of MAX\_CHUNK\_SIZE items** and assign each chunk a focus.
* For **each HLJ preview item**, produce a JSON object with:

  * `"id"`
  * `"title"` (1-line, atomic)
  * `"domain"`
  * `"subdomain"` (list)
  * `"tags"` (max 3, canonical, lowercase)
  * `"difficulty"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"priority"` ("low" | "medium" | "high")
  * `"line_source"` (e.g., "Ln 10‚Äì13")
  * (Optional: `"chunk"` and `"chunk_focus"` for easier grouping)

*Assign IDs using this pattern: `REQ-024-HLJ-Chunk_<chunk#>-Item_<item#>-v1.0`.*

# Requirement req-024 (SaaS)

SA-009: Multi-Channel Notification Templates With Delay and Personalization
Title:
Unified Multi-Channel Notification Engine With Delayed, Personalized Messaging and Advanced Analytics

Executive Summary:
To increase user engagement and drive personalized customer journeys, the platform needs a unified notification engine that supports template-driven communications across email, SMS, push, and in-app channels, with flexible delay scheduling and advanced personalization. Integrated analytics will empower marketing and product teams to optimize message timing and content, boosting activation and retention rates.

Requirements:

Template Management:

Centralize notification templates, supporting dynamic fields (user name, plan, custom offers) and multi-language variants.

Enable easy preview and testing of messages across all channels prior to launch.

Multi-Channel Delivery:

Support scheduling notifications with customizable delays (from minutes to days), per user timezone.

Automatically select optimal channel based on user preferences and delivery history.

Personalization Engine:

Integrate with user profile and behavior data to personalize content, timing, and call-to-action.

A/B test message variants and automate audience segmentation for targeted campaigns.

Analytics & Reporting:

Provide real-time dashboards showing open, click, and conversion rates per channel and template.

Trigger alerts for abnormal drop-off or deliverability issues, with self-healing workflows (e.g., fallback to another channel).

Compliance & Opt-Out:

Ensure all messages include clear opt-out/unsubscribe mechanisms and comply with CAN-SPAM, CASL, GDPR, and other regulations.

Track and log all opt-outs and message failures for audit purposes.

Edge Cases:

If delay scheduling would push a notification into a user‚Äôs nighttime (local time), automatically reschedule or prompt for override.

Prevent duplicate notifications if a user qualifies for multiple triggers within a set period.

Documentation & Training:

Develop quickstart guides for marketers, and detailed integration docs for engineers.

Update customer help center with notification preference settings.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must integrate with current comms infrastructure (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, FCM).

Timezone logic must account for daylight saving and non-standard offsets.

KPIs:

25% open rate across channels

<1% failed delivery

10% increase in user activation post-campaign
```
