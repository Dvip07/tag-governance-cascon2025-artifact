  "requirement_id": "REQ-007",
  "summary": "Implement real-time screening of new customer signups against updated AML and sanctions watchlists (OFAC, EU, UN, local), ensuring checks occur before account activation and within 3 seconds. Support vendor-agnostic, switchable screening integration with a fallback protocol for service downtime or delay beyond 5 seconds: set account to 'pending', notify Compliance, log events, and handle ambiguous matches via manual verification. All screening actions, data, and decisions must be securely audited, immutable, and privacy-compliant. Compliance must access dashboards and ad-hoc screening reports. User experience requires clear status updates and guidance during holds. All data must be encrypted per regulations, logs purged per policy, and solution tested with monitoring/alerting for anomalies. Fallback providers must have Compliance approval, with collaboration among Legal and Customer Support. Deliverables include onboarding flow updates, provider integration, compliance dashboard, documentation, and manual review training. Non-functional priorities: performance (<3s), security, compliance, availability, maintainability, usability."
