  "requirement_id": "REQ-006",
  "summary": "Implement scalable, configurable per-tenant API rate limiting for the B2B Developer Platform. Design rate limit tiers (e.g., Standard/Premium) with contract-based customization, supporting both burst and sustained limits. Integrate logic at the API gateway to enforce limits by tenant ID, providing real-time feedback (HTTP 429, retry headers) and comprehensive activity logging. Enable dynamic limit updates via admin portal. Deliver dashboards, alerts, and APIs for monitoring, reporting, and tenant self-service. Detect/mitigate abuse (key rotation, spoofing), support emergency limit lifts with audit trails, and handle outages with fallback logic. Enforce security (multi-factor approval/auditing for high-tier changes), comply with performance (\u226410ms latency) and legal requirements, and conduct phased rollout with full documentation and support tools. Deliverables: upgraded backend/gateway, management UI, monitoring/reporting, rollout plan, client communications."
