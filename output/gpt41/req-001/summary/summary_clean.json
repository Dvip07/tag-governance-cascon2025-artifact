  "requirement_id": "REQ-001",
  "summary": "Develop a RESTful API endpoint (GET /api/v2/transactions/history) to provide customers unified access to their transaction history from all integrated partner banks. The API must offer pagination, filters (date range, transaction type, partner institution), and conform to latest OpenAPI specifications. Ensure deduplication, consistent formatting, normalization of timestamps to UTC (with original timezone metadata), and harmonization of transaction types/statuses. Secure all requests with OAuth 2.0 and log access events for audit trails per ISO 27001. On partner bank outage, deliver partial results and log the issue. Meet performance targets (\u22641.5s for up to 24 months\u2019 history), and cap data caching at 5 minutes. Deliver comprehensive documentation and integration with at least five major banks. Mandatory compliance review required before deployment."
