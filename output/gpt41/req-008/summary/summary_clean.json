  "requirement_id": "REQ-008",
  "summary": "Design and deploy an automated loan origination workflow enabling gig economy workers to apply for personal loans by aggregating their income data across multiple platforms (Uber, DoorDash, Upwork, Fiverr, etc.) via API integrations. The system must normalize and verify earnings, apply dynamic eligibility rules (adjustable via an admin portal) accounting for gig income volatility, and handle edge cases like missing data or unsupported currencies. Standard KYC/AML and enhanced fraud detection are required, with compliance to local lending, privacy, and fair lending regulations. User experience must include clear consent, status feedback, earnings summaries, and options to dispute or provide additional documentation. Secure all data using encryption and role-based access, log all key activity, and provide dashboards for operations/compliance monitoring. Legal platform agreements, coordination with Credit Risk/Data Science, and clearly marketing the loan as \u201cgig income eligible\u201d are required. Deliverables include workflow UI/UX, platform integrations, eligibility engine, compliance dashboards, and support training guides."
