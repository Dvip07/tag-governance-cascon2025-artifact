System detects suspicious patterns (multiple micro-transactions from same customer/device in 24hrs), sends alerts via Slack/email/dashboard with transaction details, handles false positives through logging/ML refinement, implements rate-limiting to prevent spam, maintains audit logs, and ensures data privacy. Must integrate with existing fraud systems and receive Risk/Compliance approval before launch."
