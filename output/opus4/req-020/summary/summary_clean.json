  "requirement_id": "REQ-020",
  "summary": "CRM Contact Sync feature enabling one-click integration with major CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot) via OAuth/API keys. Implements configurable duplicate detection using email/phone/fuzzy name matching, with user-controlled merge workflows including dry run preview, side-by-side field comparison, and conflict resolution. Supports ongoing auto-sync with saved merge preferences, comprehensive change logging, and 24-hour rollback capability. Critical constraints include respecting CRM API rate limits and preserving existing contact-linked workflows. Edge cases handle webhook conflicts by pausing sync with warnings. Includes updated onboarding documentation for CRM sync and duplicate management features."
