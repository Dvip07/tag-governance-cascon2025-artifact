SA-010: Widget-Level Performance Analytics in User Dashboards
Title:
End-to-End Widget Performance Analytics and Insights for Enhanced User Dashboard Experience

Executive Summary:
Delivering a high-performance, data-driven dashboard experience is essential for retaining power users and meeting enterprise SLAs. We require granular, real-time visibility into the load and render times of individual dashboard widgets, empowering engineering teams to proactively optimize performance and product managers to monitor UX KPIs.

Requirements:

Instrumentation:

Instrument all dashboard widgets (first- and third-party) to capture load, render, and interactive readiness times.

Report timing data per widget instance, user, device, and browser context.

Visualization & Reporting:

Provide engineering dashboards with breakdowns by widget, user segment, and time window.

Flag outliers and regressions, with drill-down to root cause (e.g., CDN lag, third-party script).

Automated Alerting & Optimization:

Trigger alerts for widgets breaching performance SLAs (e.g., >2s load time for 95th percentile).

Integrate with CI/CD to block deployment of code that causes performance regressions, and suggest automated remediation steps.

Edge Cases & Resilience:

For widgets loading from external services, monitor fallback performance and alert on persistent issues.

If user dashboard exceeds performance budget, prompt user to hide or reprioritize widgets.

Compliance & Privacy:

All telemetry data must be anonymized and comply with user privacy agreements.

Offer users transparency into what performance data is collected and allow opt-out.

Documentation & Self-Service:

Provide self-service analytics for product owners to monitor widget health.

Update internal wiki with best practices and troubleshooting guides.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires upgrade of telemetry and analytics infrastructure.

Performance monitoring must not degrade dashboard responsiveness.

KPIs:

99% of dashboards load in under 2.5s

<0.5% widget-level error rate
