SA-015: Pre-Deployment UI Tests With Browser Coverage Metrics
Title:
Automated Pre-Deployment UI Testing With Real-Time Browser Coverage Analytics

Strategic Rationale:
In the drive toward agile release velocity and risk-managed delivery, we need automated UI test execution in the staging environment before every deployment. Browser coverage analytics will give teams full-spectrum visibility into test effectiveness, uncovering gaps and ensuring consistent experiences across platforms.

Requirements:

Automated Test Execution:

Run all UI regression tests on supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) in parallel in staging.

Integrate with CI/CD pipeline to block deployments if critical UI tests fail.

Coverage Analytics:

Generate real-time reports showing test coverage by browser, platform (Windows/Mac/Linux), and screen size.

Visualize gaps in coverage, prioritizing unsupported or failing configurations.

Error Reporting & Debugging:

Capture full logs, screenshots, and video recordings for failed test cases.

Summarize flakiness trends and provide actionable recommendations for stabilization.

Edge Case Handling:

Identify and flag tests that are consistently flaky only in headless mode, recommending additional review.

For unreproducible failures, offer a “quarantine” option to skip deployment blocking but notify QA leads.

Documentation & Enablement:

Maintain up-to-date testing and triage guides for engineering and QA teams.

Share browser support matrix with product and customer support.

Security & Compliance:

Ensure test artifacts (logs, screenshots) are retained securely and only accessible by authorized personnel.

Track compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG) as part of the test suite.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires maintenance of cloud/browser farm infrastructure.

Must not add more than 10 minutes to typical CI/CD build pipeline.

KPIs:

99% UI regression coverage across browsers

<5% flake rate on critical paths

<12hr average time-to-fix for newly discovered browser bugs
