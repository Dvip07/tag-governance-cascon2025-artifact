SA-011: Automated NPS Feedback Triggering With Behavioral Intelligence
Title:
Behaviorally Intelligent Net Promoter Score (NPS) Triggering to Maximize Actionable Feedback

Executive Summary:
To enable data-driven customer success and close the loop on user sentiment, we will deploy a smart NPS feedback engine that uses behavioral intelligence to automatically prompt users for feedback at optimal momentsâ€”post-onboarding, after the fifth login, or following key feature adoption. Insights will be tracked in real time and used to drive continuous improvement in product and customer support.

Requirements:

Behavioral Triggers:

Define flexible rules to auto-trigger NPS surveys after specific user actions (e.g., five logins, feature X completed, account milestone reached).

Add logic to delay or suppress surveys if user shows signs of churn (e.g., no activity in the last week).

User Experience:

Embed NPS prompt natively in web and mobile apps, minimizing disruption to workflow.

If a user ignores or dismisses the survey, retry once after a cooling-off period, then suppress further prompts for 30 days.

Analytics & Insights:

Visualize response rates, NPS scores, and trends by cohort, segment, and event type.

Integrate NPS results with CRM and customer support workflows for proactive outreach.

Compliance & Data Privacy:

Ensure all survey data is stored in compliance with privacy standards and accessible for audit.

Allow users to opt out of feedback requests at any time.

Edge Cases & Tuning:

For power users who interact across multiple devices, coordinate to avoid duplicate survey prompts.

In case of conflicting triggers (e.g., milestone + login in the same session), prioritize by recency or highest-value action.

Documentation & Enablement:

Update product training and onboarding materials for teams using NPS insights.

Provide a feedback loop for internal teams to refine triggering rules and survey content.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Integration required with analytics, CRM, and support ticketing platforms.

Surveys must be localized for key markets.

KPIs:

Survey response rate >20%

90% NPS response mapped to user action

Time from survey completion to support follow-up under 24h
