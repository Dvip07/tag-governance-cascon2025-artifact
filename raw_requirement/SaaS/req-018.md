SA-003: Shared Inbox With Tagging and Assignment Rules
Title:
Develop Shared Team Inbox With Tag-Based Routing and Reply Assignment

Background:
Support and sales teams handle high volumes of incoming emails. To avoid confusion and duplicate work, we need a shared inbox with smart assignment features and tagging.

Requirements:

Inbox Design:

Build a shared inbox where team members can see, tag, and assign emails.

Allow multiple tags per email (e.g., “Urgent,” “Billing,” “Feature Request”).

Assignment Rules:

Enable rules for automatic assignment (e.g., all “Billing” tagged emails go to the finance team).

Support manual reassignment and marking as “unassigned.”

Collision Handling:

Prevent multiple users from replying to the same email at once; lock or warn if someone else is drafting a response.

If a reply is sent, mark the email as “handled” and notify others.

Search & Reporting:

Provide filters/search by tag, assignment, and status.

Generate reports showing response times, volume by tag, and team workload.

Edge Cases:

If two agents try to assign themselves at the same time, resolve with a simple “first come, first served” rule and alert both.

If a tag is removed that affects an assignment rule, prompt to reassign or unassign as needed.

Docs & Support:

Document the tagging and assignment logic for onboarding and support.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must integrate with existing email systems (IMAP, Gmail, O365).

Changes must not disrupt current workflows for teams not using the shared inbox.
