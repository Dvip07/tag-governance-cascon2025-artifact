SA-004: Cohort Analysis With Time-Decaying Weight for Retention Metrics
Title:
Add Cohort Analysis With Time-Decaying Weight for Retention Tracking

Background:
Understanding user retention requires more than just flat cohort tracking. Product and growth teams need to see how retention evolves, factoring in recency and giving more weight to recent cohorts.

Requirements:

Cohort Definition:

Allow users to create and save custom cohorts based on signup date, product usage events, or key milestones.

Cohorts should update automatically as new users match the criteria.

Time-Decay Metrics:

Apply a time-decay weighting to retention and activity metricsâ€”recent actions/users count more than older ones.

Make the decay function adjustable (e.g., exponential, linear) via settings.

Visualization:

Display results as trend lines and cohort heatmaps, with the ability to overlay standard and time-decayed metrics.

Allow export to CSV or PDF for reporting.

Edge Cases:

Handle duplicate cohort membership (users in multiple overlapping cohorts).

If decay parameters are set too aggressively (causing zeroed-out metrics), prompt the user to adjust.

Docs & Support:

Provide a help article explaining cohort logic, decay weighting, and best practices.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Needs to work with existing analytics data store.

Must not degrade dashboard load times by more than 20%.
