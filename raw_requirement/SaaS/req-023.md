SA-008: Geo-Targeted Feature Flag Rollouts With Real-Time Analytics
Title:
Geo-Targeted Feature Flag Rollouts Leveraging Real-Time Analytics for Progressive Delivery

Executive Summary:
As part of our ongoing initiative to embrace progressive delivery and drive customer-centric innovation, we require the ability to roll out new features to targeted user segments based on geographic location, with integrated real-time analytics for performance monitoring and rapid rollback. This capability will support A/B testing, risk mitigation, and personalized product experiences, accelerating our time-to-value across global markets.

Requirements:

Feature Flag Framework:

Implement a scalable feature flag system that supports user segmentation by country, region, and city.

Allow percentage-based rollouts (e.g., release to 10% of users in Canada, 100% in the UK).

Flags must be dynamically adjustable via an admin portal, with immediate effect across the platform.

Geo-IP and Segmentation:

Integrate with a real-time Geo-IP resolution service to determine user location at the point of feature evaluation.

Include robust handling for users on VPNs, proxies, or with missing/ambiguous geo-data (e.g., fallback to global defaults).

Real-Time Analytics & Observability:

Provide dashboards displaying adoption metrics, error rates, and conversion KPIs by geography and cohort.

Trigger automated alerts for negative impact (e.g., spike in errors or support tickets in a region) and allow one-click rollback.

User Experience and Compliance:

Inform users if they are part of a beta or staged rollout, including opt-out options where applicable.

Ensure all geo-targeted delivery respects regional data residency and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Edge Case Handling:

In case of Geo-IP mismatch (e.g., mobile users crossing borders), flag feature toggling events for audit and analytics.

Rollback must revert changes instantly, with full traceability.

Documentation & Enablement:

Create onboarding material for product managers and developers on setting up and analyzing feature flags.

Maintain a change log of all flag adjustments, rollouts, and rollbacks for compliance audits.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires upgrade of authentication and session services for location awareness.

Analytics and logging must integrate with existing BI stack (e.g., Snowflake, Looker).

KPIs:

Rollback time under 30 seconds

<0.2% error rate during rollout

Feature adoption per geo-segment within first 72 hours
