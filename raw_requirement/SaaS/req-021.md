SA-006: Inline Comment Threads on Uploaded PDFs
Title:
Enable Inline Commenting and Threaded Discussions on Uploaded PDFs

Background:
Teams often review documents together and need to leave feedback directly on specific pages or sections. Our document module should support threaded comments within PDFs.

Requirements:

Commenting UX:

Allow users to highlight text or click anywhere on a PDF to start a comment thread.

Replies should nest beneath the original comment, supporting at least two levels deep.

Show unresolved vs. resolved comment status with quick filters.

Notifications:

Notify document owners and participants when a new comment or reply is added, or a thread is resolved.

Include direct links to the commented section.

Edge Cases:

When PDFs are updated (new version uploaded), attempt to preserve comments or warn users if positions have shifted.

Prevent overlapping or duplicate highlights in the same spot.

Docs & Support:

Add a quickstart guide for commenting features and best practices for feedback.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must work with major browsers and PDF viewers.

No performance drop on large (100+ page) PDFs.
