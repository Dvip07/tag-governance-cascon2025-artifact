SA-009: Multi-Channel Notification Templates With Delay and Personalization
Title:
Unified Multi-Channel Notification Engine With Delayed, Personalized Messaging and Advanced Analytics

Executive Summary:
To increase user engagement and drive personalized customer journeys, the platform needs a unified notification engine that supports template-driven communications across email, SMS, push, and in-app channels, with flexible delay scheduling and advanced personalization. Integrated analytics will empower marketing and product teams to optimize message timing and content, boosting activation and retention rates.

Requirements:

Template Management:

Centralize notification templates, supporting dynamic fields (user name, plan, custom offers) and multi-language variants.

Enable easy preview and testing of messages across all channels prior to launch.

Multi-Channel Delivery:

Support scheduling notifications with customizable delays (from minutes to days), per user timezone.

Automatically select optimal channel based on user preferences and delivery history.

Personalization Engine:

Integrate with user profile and behavior data to personalize content, timing, and call-to-action.

A/B test message variants and automate audience segmentation for targeted campaigns.

Analytics & Reporting:

Provide real-time dashboards showing open, click, and conversion rates per channel and template.

Trigger alerts for abnormal drop-off or deliverability issues, with self-healing workflows (e.g., fallback to another channel).

Compliance & Opt-Out:

Ensure all messages include clear opt-out/unsubscribe mechanisms and comply with CAN-SPAM, CASL, GDPR, and other regulations.

Track and log all opt-outs and message failures for audit purposes.

Edge Cases:

If delay scheduling would push a notification into a userâ€™s nighttime (local time), automatically reschedule or prompt for override.

Prevent duplicate notifications if a user qualifies for multiple triggers within a set period.

Documentation & Training:

Develop quickstart guides for marketers, and detailed integration docs for engineers.

Update customer help center with notification preference settings.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must integrate with current comms infrastructure (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, FCM).

Timezone logic must account for daylight saving and non-standard offsets.

KPIs:

25% open rate across channels

<1% failed delivery

10% increase in user activation post-campaign
