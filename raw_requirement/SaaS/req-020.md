SA-005: CRM Contact Sync With Duplicate Merge Rules
Title:
Sync Contacts From Third-Party CRMs With Duplicate Merge Handling

Background:
Many customers connect their Salesforce, HubSpot, or other CRM accounts to sync contacts. We need to handle duplicate detection and merge logic in a user-friendly way.

Requirements:

Sync & Import:

Support one-click sync with major CRMs via OAuth and API keys.

On initial sync, import all contacts, with a dry run showing potential duplicates before merging.

Duplicate Detection & Merge:

Use configurable rules (e.g., email match, phone match, fuzzy name) to flag duplicates.

Allow users to review and resolve matches: “merge,” “keep separate,” or “ignore.”

If conflicting data exists, show a side-by-side diff and let users pick field values to keep.

Ongoing Sync:

Automatically merge new duplicates based on saved preferences.

Log all merges and changes, showing a history per contact.

Edge Cases:

If a merge would create conflicting webhook updates, warn the user and pause the sync.

Support rollback for accidental merges within 24 hours.

Docs & Support:

Update onboarding guide for CRM sync and duplicate management.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must respect API rate limits for each CRM provider.

Merge logic must not disrupt existing contact-linked workflows.
