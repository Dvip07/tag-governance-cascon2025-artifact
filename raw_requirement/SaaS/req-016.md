SA-001: Role-Based Two-Factor Authentication Enforcement
Title:
Enable Role-Based Enforcement of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) With App-Specific Overrides

Background & Rationale:
Security needs vary by user role. We want a flexible way to enforce 2FA so admins and finance users always have it on, but standard users can opt in. There are also app-specific quirks (e.g., mobile app currently doesn’t support our 2FA solution).

Requirements:

Role-Based Rules:

Enforce 2FA for all users in “Admin,” “Finance,” and “DevOps” roles.

Other roles (“User,” “Viewer”) can enable 2FA optionally.

Roles should be dynamic—if a user is promoted/demoted, 2FA policy updates immediately.

App-Specific Overrides:

Allow the mobile app to exempt users from mandatory 2FA enforcement (until the app supports it).

Web and desktop apps must always respect the 2FA requirement.

User Experience:

Notify users about 2FA enforcement at login and provide clear setup instructions.

If a user logs in via a channel that doesn’t support 2FA, inform them of the limitation and next steps.

Edge Cases & Reporting:

Track and log all policy exceptions (e.g., a required 2FA user logging in via mobile).

Expose a report for security/admins listing all users out of compliance or exempted.

Documentation & Support:

Update help articles and admin guides to reflect these changes.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Coordination needed with mobile dev team for future 2FA rollout.

Must not lock out existing users during migration.
