SA-012: RTL Layout & Mirrored UI Support in the Visual Builder
Title:
Comprehensive Support for Right-to-Left (RTL) Layouts and Mirrored User Interfaces in the Visual UI Builder

Strategic Context:
To deliver on our global-first, inclusive design mandate and win business in emerging markets, our platform must provide end-to-end support for right-to-left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, etc.) in all customer-facing interfaces. This future-ready enhancement will ensure our visual builder empowers teams to create regionally compliant, fully mirrored UIs, eliminating technical debt from ad-hoc workarounds and boosting our international expansion.

Requirements:

Core RTL Engine:

Implement a robust RTL layout engine for the UI builder that toggles all flex, grid, and positioning properties for correct mirroring.

Ensure component libraries, icons, and navigation elements render accurately in RTL mode.

Designer Empowerment:

Allow designers to preview layouts instantly in both LTR and RTL modes.

Support per-section and per-component overrides for mixed-language pages.

Localization & Translation:

Integrate with translation memory services for rapid string swapping, preserving markup and context.

Handle locale-specific formatting for dates, currencies, and numerals.

Edge Cases & Validation:

Flag components that break under mirroring (e.g., sliders, progress bars), and offer remediation guidance.

Validate page exports to ensure accessibility and usability standards (WCAG, ADA) are maintained in RTL output.

Operational Transparency:

Provide detailed logs and change history for layout adjustments, to assist in QA and regional compliance audits.

Documentation & Enablement:

Create a “Designing for RTL” best practices guide and update onboarding materials.

Host webinars or workshops to upskill internal teams and partners.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Component updates may require vendor coordination.

Must not regress performance or accessibility for LTR users.

KPIs:

95% component compatibility in RTL mode

Time-to-publish for RTL pages < 2x LTR

Customer satisfaction in targeted regions up 20% post-launch
