SA-013: Sentiment- and Urgency-Based Ticket Routing for Helpdesk
Title:
AI-Driven Sentiment and Urgency Classification for Intelligent Ticket Routing in Helpdesk

Strategic Value:
To drive operational efficiency and empower support teams, we need to infuse our helpdesk with AI-powered sentiment and urgency detection. By auto-classifying incoming tickets, we can route high-priority or emotionally negative cases to senior agents, accelerating resolution and enhancing the customer experience. This lays the foundation for scalable, proactive support operations.

Requirements:

NLP Sentiment Engine:

Integrate a sentiment analysis model to classify tickets as positive, neutral, or negative upon receipt.

Fine-tune urgency detection to flag language indicating immediate action is required (e.g., “can’t log in,” “critical outage”).

Routing Logic:

Auto-route negative or urgent tickets to senior agents or escalation queues.

Route routine inquiries to self-service or standard agent pools.

Reporting & Feedback:

Track resolution time and customer satisfaction for each sentiment/urgency class.

Surface trends (e.g., spike in negative tickets after release) for product/ops review.

Edge Cases:

Detect and handle sarcasm or ambiguous tone using secondary cues (e.g., ticket history, emoji analysis).

Allow agents to reclassify sentiment/urgency if model is incorrect, feeding back into continuous learning.

Compliance & Transparency:

Log all classification decisions and routing actions for audit and improvement.

Allow users to opt out of automated sentiment classification in settings.

Documentation:

Publish guidelines for agents on interpreting and correcting sentiment/urgency scores.

Update customer help content to explain AI-driven routing.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must not delay ticket processing by more than 500ms per ticket.

Requires buy-in from support leadership and training for teams.

KPIs:

Average resolution time for negative/urgent tickets down 30%

85% model accuracy on labeled training set

90% agent satisfaction with routing recommendations
