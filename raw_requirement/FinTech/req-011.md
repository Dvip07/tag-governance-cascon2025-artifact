FT-011: Flexible EMI Options at Checkout Based on Creditworthiness
Title:
Implementation of Dynamic EMI (Equated Monthly Installments) Options at Checkout Based on Real-Time Creditworthiness Assessment

Background & Objective:
To increase conversion rates and customer loyalty, we aim to offer flexible EMI options directly at checkout. The available EMI tenures and interest rates should be personalized in real time based on each customer’s creditworthiness, determined by internal and third-party credit scoring systems. This will provide a competitive edge in e-commerce and point-of-sale channels.

Scope of Requirement:

Real-Time Creditworthiness Assessment:

Integrate with internal and external credit bureaus to retrieve up-to-date credit scores for customers at the time of checkout.

Implement a decision engine to map credit score bands to eligible EMI plans (e.g., 3, 6, 12 months) and corresponding interest rates.

All scoring and eligibility checks must be completed within 2 seconds to avoid checkout friction.

Dynamic EMI Offering:

Display only the EMI plans the customer qualifies for, with clear disclosure of monthly payment amounts, APR, and total cost.

If a customer's credit band changes post-approval (e.g., due to rapid repayment activity), trigger re-validation before funds disbursement.

Edge Case Handling:

For “borderline” customers (on the edge between two bands), allow manual override by support staff with appropriate justification.

If credit score lookup fails or times out, offer default EMI options with conservative limits and flag the transaction for post-settlement review.

User Experience & Transparency:

Provide an EMI calculator in the checkout flow for users to explore options before selecting.

Present all terms in plain language, including prepayment penalties, missed payment consequences, and dispute resolution process.

Compliance & Security:

All data sharing and storage must comply with applicable lending and privacy laws (e.g., FCRA, GDPR).

Ensure user consent is obtained for all credit checks.

Log all decision engine inputs and outputs for audit and regulatory review.

Monitoring & Reporting:

Monitor EMI adoption rates, approval declines, and band-shifting events, providing regular analytics to Product and Risk teams.

Maintain an override log with reviewer, justification, and resolution details.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Agreements must be in place with credit scoring partners for real-time API access.

Any changes to EMI logic must go through Product, Legal, and Compliance review.

Requires updates to checkout UI and backend payment orchestration.

Deliverables:

Checkout and EMI calculator updates

Decision engine logic and integration docs

Analytics dashboard

User and support documentation

Audit and override logs
