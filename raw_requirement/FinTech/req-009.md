FT-009: Scheduled Cross-Border Payments with FX Lock
Title:
Implementation of Scheduled Cross-Border Payments With Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate Lock

Background & Objective:
Cross-border payments are often subject to volatile FX rates, making it challenging for users to plan and predict costs for scheduled future transactions. This requirement focuses on implementing a scheduled payments feature for cross-border transfers, where users can “lock in” an FX rate for a defined time window, providing price certainty and transparency.

Scope of Requirement:

User Interface & Workflow:

Extend the payments UI to allow users to schedule cross-border payments, select a desired execution date, and preview the applicable FX rate.

Offer the option to “lock” the quoted FX rate for a predefined time window (e.g., 24 hours) after scheduling.

Clearly display rate expiry details, conditions, and countdown timers.

FX Rate Management:

Integrate with FX rate providers to fetch real-time rates and manage rate lock commitments.

If a user locks an FX rate but fails to fund the payment before expiry, automatically revert to the prevailing market rate and notify the user.

Record all locked rates, associated metadata, and expiry timestamps for reconciliation and audit.

Payment Processing:

At execution time, validate that the original locked rate is still applicable. If expired, inform the user and require confirmation before proceeding at the new rate.

Allow partial or full cancellation of scheduled payments before execution, with appropriate refund and notification logic.

Compliance & Risk:

Implement controls to prevent abuse of rate locks (e.g., repeated lock/cancel cycles to speculate on rates).

Adhere to regulatory requirements for cross-border payments and FX disclosures, including required documentation for large-value transfers.

Maintain audit logs for all scheduling, locking, and execution events.

Notifications & Reporting:

Send users confirmation, reminders, and expiry alerts via email, SMS, and in-app notifications.

Provide dashboards for finance and compliance teams to monitor outstanding scheduled payments, locked rates, and exceptions.

Edge Case Handling:

If the FX provider is temporarily unavailable, restrict scheduling of new payments and clearly communicate the issue to users.

Handle “orphaned” scheduled payments where the user’s account balance is insufficient at execution time (e.g., auto-cancel or retry logic).

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires contractual agreements and stable APIs with one or more FX providers.

Must ensure no negative impact on payment processing SLAs or regulatory deadlines.

Feature to be rolled out in limited beta before general availability.

Deliverables:

Updated payment scheduling UI and logic

FX provider integration modules

Audit and reporting tools

User and support documentation

Beta rollout plan with feedback collection framework
