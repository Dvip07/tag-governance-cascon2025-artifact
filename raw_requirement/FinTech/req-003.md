FT-003: Fraud Alert for Micro-Transactions
Title:
Automated Fraud Alert Trigger for Micro-Transactions

Background & Objective:
Emerging fraud patterns increasingly involve micro-transactions (transactions under $1), which may bypass conventional alert thresholds. To protect customers and improve fraud detection, an automated system must be developed to flag and notify relevant teams when suspicious patterns involving micro-transactions are detected.

Requirement Details:

Detection Logic:

Implement configurable rules to identify patterns of multiple micro-transactions originating from the same customer or device within a short time window (default: 24 hours).

Allow rules to be refined based on transaction frequency, merchant type, and time of day.

Alerting & Notification:

Upon detection, generate real-time alerts to the Fraud Operations team via existing channels (Slack, email, dashboard widget).

Each alert should include transaction details, customer ID, merchant info, and rule(s) triggered.

Edge Case Handling:

False positives (e.g., app store micropayments, legitimate donations) must be logged and used to continuously update and improve detection rules.

System must prevent alert spam by rate-limiting notifications per customer.

Audit & Reporting:

Maintain detailed logs of all triggered alerts, investigations, and their outcomes.

Provide periodic summary reports for compliance and risk review.

Security & Privacy:

Ensure no sensitive customer data is exposed in alert payloads beyond what is necessary for investigation.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must integrate with existing fraud monitoring systems and alerting infrastructure.

Initial ruleset must be reviewed and signed off by Risk and Compliance before go-live.
