FT-012: GST Support for B2B SaaS Vendors with Provincial Rate Handling
Title:
GST Calculation and Reporting Module for B2B SaaS Vendors Supporting Varying Provincial Tax Rates

Background & Objective:
To expand our B2B SaaS offering into new Canadian provinces, we must support complex Goods and Services Tax (GST) rules, including varying provincial rates, exemptions, and dual-tax provinces. Accurate GST calculation, transparent invoicing, and compliant reporting are non-negotiable to avoid legal penalties and ensure customer trust.

Scope of Requirement:

Tax Rate Management:

Maintain a dynamic tax rate table for all supported provinces, automatically updating in response to government rate changes.

Support dual-GST provinces (e.g., Quebec with both federal and provincial GST) and ensure correct allocation and calculation logic.

Invoice & Billing Logic:

Apply the correct GST rate(s) at the time of invoice generation, based on customer billing address, service location, and applicable exemptions.

Clearly itemize GST components on all invoices, showing breakdowns for federal and provincial portions where applicable.

Support scenarios where multiple tax rates apply on a single invoice (e.g., split shipments/services).

Exemption & Edge Case Handling:

Allow for tax-exempt status to be recorded and applied per customer, with validation logic and required documentation.

Handle retroactive rate changesâ€”if rates are updated between order and billing, ensure proper adjustment and customer notification.

Implement fallback rules for ambiguous addresses or missing location data, defaulting to federal GST and flagging for manual review.

Reporting & Compliance:

Generate GST summary reports per province, supporting both accrual and cash accounting methods.

Provide audit-ready exports for finance and compliance teams, including transaction-level detail and reconciliation tools.

Log all tax rate changes, overrides, and manual adjustments with user metadata for traceability.

User Experience:

Update self-service portals for customers to view/download GST-compliant invoices and tax summary statements.

Provide helpdesk scripts and documentation to support GST-related queries.

Security & Privacy:

Protect all customer and transaction data in line with PIPEDA and GDPR requirements.

Limit access to tax-related configuration and reporting features to authorized finance/admin roles.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires integration with government tax rate APIs (where available).

Must coordinate with Finance, Legal, and Support teams for implementation and go-live communications.

Deliverables:

Updated billing and invoice modules

Tax rate management UI

Reporting and export tools

Customer and support documentation

Audit and compliance logs
