FT-014: Blockchain Wallet Gas-Fee Estimation Pre-Transaction
Title:
Add Pre-Transaction Gas-Fee Estimation for Blockchain Wallet Users

Background & Objective:
To enhance transparency and usability for blockchain wallet users, the platform must provide gas-fee estimation prior to transaction confirmation. This feature reduces failed transactions, improves user trust, and is crucial as blockchain network congestion and gas price volatility impact transaction cost and timing.

Scope of Requirement:

Fee Estimation Logic:

Integrate with blockchain explorers and fee oracles to retrieve real-time gas fee estimates for supported networks (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).

Show a range (min/expected/max) and update estimates dynamically if user delays confirmation.

Include estimation for various transaction types: simple transfers, contract calls, token swaps, etc.

User Experience & UI:

Display the estimated gas fee and the total transaction cost (including network fees) before user confirmation.

Offer advanced users an option to adjust gas parameters (e.g., price, limit) with inline guidance.

If fee spikes occur due to pending transaction pool congestion, highlight this with warnings and advice.

Edge Case & Error Handling:

For networks experiencing instability or delayed fee data, communicate potential inaccuracy and suggest waiting or retry.

If the gas-fee estimate cannot be retrieved, disable transaction confirmation until resolved.

Security & Compliance:

Ensure all user data and transaction parameters are securely handled in compliance with privacy and security policies.

Log all fee queries and confirmations for future troubleshooting and audit.

Notifications & Support:

Provide help documentation explaining gas fees and troubleshooting steps for failed or stuck transactions.

Offer customer support a summary log of recent estimates and user actions.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Must support fee estimation for at least three networks at launch.

No impact on transaction signing or security logic.

Deliverables:

Updated wallet UI and backend logic

Fee oracle integration modules

Support documentation and FAQ updates

Audit and monitoring scripts
