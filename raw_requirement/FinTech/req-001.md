FT-001: Unified Transaction History API
Title:
Unified Customer Transaction History Retrieval API

Background & Objective:
In the context of Open Banking partnerships, customers increasingly expect seamless access to their financial history, regardless of the originating partner bank or financial institution. To address this demand and meet evolving regulatory and user experience standards, the platform must provide a unified API endpoint for the retrieval of customer transaction history spanning all integrated partner banks.

Requirement Details:

API Design:

Develop a RESTful API endpoint (GET /api/v2/transactions/history) that retrieves a consolidated list of a customer's transaction history across all connected partner banks.

The API must support pagination, filtering by date range, transaction type, and partner institution.

All requests and responses must adhere to the latest OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.

Data Consistency & Integrity:

The API must ensure data is de-duplicated and consistently formatted, regardless of the source institution.

Where source systems use different time zones, normalize all timestamps to UTC, and include the original time zone as a metadata field.

Security & Compliance:

Authenticate all requests using OAuth 2.0 with per-customer access tokens.

Log all access events and support audit trail requirements per ISO 27001.

Edge Cases:

Handle discrepancies in transaction types and status fields between institutions (e.g., pending, reversed, declined).

If a partner bank’s API is unavailable, provide partial results and log the outage in the API response.

Performance:

The API should return responses within 1.5 seconds for up to 24 months of transaction history per request.

Documentation & Support:

Provide comprehensive API documentation, example requests/responses, and contact channels for partner developers.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Integration with at least five major partner banks’ APIs is required for initial rollout.

Any data caching must not exceed a freshness window of 5 minutes.

Compliance review is mandatory prior to production deployment.
