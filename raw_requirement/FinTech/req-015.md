Title:
Implement Webhook-Based Claim Status Notifications for Insurance API With Support for Custom Data Fields

Background & Objective:
Our insurance API partners and enterprise customers increasingly require real-time status updates on claim submissions, approvals, and payouts. To meet this need, we will implement webhook triggers for key claim status changes, supporting delivery of both standard and custom fields as required by each client. This enhances transparency, integration capability, and client satisfaction.

Scope of Requirement:

Webhook Event Framework:

Design a webhook system to notify external systems of claim status changes (submitted, in review, approved, rejected, paid).

Allow clients to register endpoints, specify desired events, and provide custom field mappings as part of their integration profile.

Custom Field Support:

Enable clients to specify additional data fields (e.g., claim type, incident date, reference IDs) to be included in the webhook payload.

Validate that custom fields do not conflict with reserved or standard schema fields; enforce naming and type constraints.

Reliability & Delivery Guarantees:

Implement retry logic for failed webhook deliveries, with exponential backoff and notification of persistent failures.

Provide delivery status and logs to clients via API or dashboard.

Security & Compliance:

Require endpoint verification (shared secret or signed payloads) before sending notifications.

Allow clients to manage, pause, or revoke webhook registrations via self-service portal.

Log all webhook events, payloads, and delivery outcomes for compliance and troubleshooting.

Edge Case Handling:

If a custom field conflicts with webhook schema, reject registration with detailed validation errors.

For clients with high-frequency updates, implement rate limits and notify on threshold breaches.

Documentation & Support:

Provide sample payloads, setup guides, and troubleshooting documentation.

Train support teams on common webhook integration issues.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires upgrades to insurance claims processing system and API.

Webhook system must scale to support enterprise clients with high event volumes.

Deliverables:

Webhook management UI and backend logic

Documentation and sample integrations

Compliance and monitoring scripts

Client and support training guides
