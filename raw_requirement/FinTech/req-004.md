FT-004: Enhanced Audit Logs for GDPR v2 Compliance
Title:
Enhancement of Audit Log Infrastructure for Full GDPR v2 Right-to-Erasure Support

Background & Business Objective:
With the implementation of the latest GDPR v2 regulations and increasing global pressure on privacy and data protection, it is critical that our audit logging infrastructure supports comprehensive, fine-grained, and compliant right-to-erasure capabilities. The current logging system, while robust for operational monitoring and internal forensics, lacks the architectural mechanisms necessary for both the complete and partial deletion of user-related log entries in response to right-to-erasure (RtE) requests. Failure to meet these requirements poses both regulatory and reputational risks.

This initiative aims to upgrade the audit log infrastructure to be fully compliant with GDPR v2—specifically, to enable secure, traceable, and policy-driven log deletion workflows without compromising system integrity or the needs of legitimate compliance auditing.

Scope of Requirement:

Audit Log Structuring & Metadata:

All audit logs must be refactored to include user-specific metadata fields, enabling direct mapping of log events to user records, even if indirect identifiers (e.g., pseudonyms, hashed IDs) are used.

Log entries must be classified as either “personal data” or “operational data,” in accordance with the GDPR v2 guidelines.

Implement a data lineage mechanism to trace all downstream dependencies for each log entry.

Right-to-Erasure Workflow:

On receipt of an RtE request, the system must trigger an automated process to identify and flag all audit logs containing personal data related to the user.

Provide dual-mode deletion:
a) Full Deletion: Completely remove eligible personal data from logs, rendering it unrecoverable.
b) Partial Deletion (Redaction): Mask or redact user-identifiable fields in entries where full deletion would impact operational or compliance auditability.

Log all RtE actions (meta-logs) with reason codes, requestor identity, affected records, and date/time for downstream audit.

Edge Case Handling:

For composite log entries involving multiple users, enable selective field-level redaction while preserving unrelated user data.

Where deletion is restricted by legal retention requirements, document the rationale and restrict access to such records via role-based controls.

Security & Integrity:

All deletion/redaction operations must be tamper-evident, with cryptographic checksums before/after action and hash chaining of meta-logs.

Provide APIs for internal compliance teams to review, approve, or deny individual deletion/redaction operations before execution.

Operational Monitoring & Reporting:

Implement dashboard views and scheduled reports to track RtE requests, processing times, exceptions, and compliance metrics.

All actions must be logged in real time and stored in a secure, access-controlled meta-log system.

Testing & Validation:

Mandatory integration and regression tests to ensure no “ghost” data persists post-deletion.

Simulate edge cases (e.g., conflicting deletion vs. retention requirements) and provide fail-loud alerts for manual intervention.

Dependencies & Constraints:

This initiative must not compromise the performance of the audit log system during peak transaction periods.

Any vendor solutions (e.g., managed log services) must demonstrate compliance with GDPR v2 and provide supporting certifications.

Must be implemented in coordination with the Legal, Security, and Compliance teams; sign-off required prior to deployment.
