FT-010: Dual-Ledger Posting with Reconcilable Phantom Balances
Title:
Enable Dual-Ledger Transaction Posting With Reconcilable Phantom Balances

Background & Objective:
The evolution of our financial product suite—including multi-currency wallets and complex B2B services—has exposed gaps in current ledger reconciliation, especially for advanced use cases such as pre-authorizations, holds, and merchant settlements. Our current single-ledger architecture cannot efficiently support "phantom" (temporary or pending) transactions and real-time reconciliation between operational and reporting ledgers.

This requirement targets the design and implementation of a dual-ledger posting mechanism, introducing a robust structure for phantom balances, real-time reconciliation, and audit-ready transparency.

Scope of Requirement:

Dual-Ledger Structure:

Implement two parallel ledgers:
a) Operational Ledger – for real-time posting, holds, and day-to-day transactional logic
b) Reporting Ledger – for financial reporting, regulatory filings, and month-end reconciliation

All transactions must be posted to both ledgers, with metadata linking corresponding entries.

Phantom balances (temporary holds or pending transactions) must be tracked in the operational ledger, clearly differentiated from settled balances.

Phantom Balance Management:

Develop logic for creating, updating, and expiring phantom transactions, including clear rules for conversion to settled or reversal status.

Phantom balances should be immediately visible to customers (e.g., “pending” status in UI), and to internal teams via dashboard.

Provide scheduled batch processes to reconcile phantom vs. settled balances daily, with exception reporting for mismatches.

Reconciliation & Exception Handling:

Build reconciliation tools to detect and resolve mismatches between operational and reporting ledgers, flagging exceptions for review.

Allow manual and automated resolution workflows, with full audit trails for all actions.

In the case of reversals or adjustments (e.g., expired authorizations), propagate changes to both ledgers with historical tracking.

Security & Compliance:

Ensure all postings, updates, and reversals are logged with immutable audit trails.

Access to ledger data must be role-based and enforce least-privilege principles.

Meet or exceed regulatory standards for ledger management, including SOX and PCI-DSS.

Edge Case Handling:

Handle cases of “phantom reversals” (phantom balance is reversed before settlement), with clear UI and reporting logic.

Support for multi-currency transactions, including conversion logic for reporting ledger entries.

If batch reconciliation fails, trigger alerts and restrict further settlement actions until resolved.

Testing, Monitoring, & Documentation:

Develop comprehensive test plans covering creation, settlement, reversal, and reconciliation scenarios.

Monitor all ledger activities, flagging anomalies in near real time.

Deliver updated API documentation, data model diagrams, and reconciliation SOPs.

Dependencies & Constraints:

May require phased migration from legacy single-ledger architecture.

Performance overhead must remain within 10% of current posting throughput.

Requires sign-off from Finance, Risk, and Compliance teams.

Deliverables:

Updated ledgers, APIs, and monitoring tools

Exception management dashboards

Migration and rollback plan
