FT-013: Batch Payouts to Sellers with Failure Rollback Tracking
Title:
Implementation of Batch Payout Processing for Marketplace Sellers With Transaction Failure Rollback and Audit

Background & Objective:
As marketplace volume grows, seller payout operations increasingly involve large-scale batch processing. To minimize manual interventions and payment errors, we require a robust batch payout engine that supports partial and complete rollback in case of transaction failures. This will ensure trust with sellers, simplify reconciliation, and maintain compliance with payment regulations.

Scope of Requirement:

Batch Processing Logic:

Develop a batch payout engine to initiate, track, and reconcile payouts to multiple sellers in a single operation.

Each batch must log all component transactions with unique IDs and metadata (seller ID, amount, method, status).

Support scheduled and on-demand batch payouts, with configurability for batch size, currency, and payout window.

Failure Handling & Rollback:

If any transaction within a batch fails (e.g., bank error, insufficient funds, compliance hold), provide options for:

Rolling back the entire batch

Re-attempting only failed transactions

Marking partial successes and logging exceptions

All rollback actions must maintain atomicity—no “stranded” funds.

Audit Trail & Reporting:

Record detailed logs for all batch operations, transaction attempts, rollbacks, and manual overrides.

Generate exception and summary reports for finance, support, and compliance teams.

Provide an admin dashboard to view batch status, drill down into individual payouts, and initiate rollback or retry actions.

Notifications & Communication:

Notify sellers of payout status (success, partial, failed) via email, in-app, and/or SMS, with detailed reason codes for failures.

If a payout is rolled back, inform affected sellers and provide clear next steps or rescheduling info.

Compliance & Security:

Ensure compliance with financial regulations (e.g., AML, KYC, local banking rules).

Log all data changes and restrict sensitive operations to authorized personnel.

Support audit export and data retention per compliance requirements.

Edge Case Handling:

Handle mixed-currency payouts and split payments (single seller, multiple bank accounts).

In the event of a systemic processor outage, pause all new batch payouts and notify admin users.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires integration with payment processors and internal seller management systems.

Rollback operations must not impact system performance during peak payout cycles.

Deliverables:

Batch payout engine & admin UI

Exception reporting tools

Audit and notification logic
