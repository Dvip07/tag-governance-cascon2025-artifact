FT-005: Virtual Card Freeze/Unfreeze via Mobile App
Title:
Enable User-Controlled Freezing and Unfreezing of Virtual Debit and Credit Cards Through Mobile Application

Background & Business Objective:
As digital banking becomes the norm, customers expect high degrees of self-service, transparency, and security when managing their payment instruments. One increasingly demanded feature is the ability to instantly freeze or unfreeze virtual cards through the mobile app—empowering users to control their cards in real time, especially in suspected fraud or loss scenarios.

The objective is to design, implement, and deploy a robust, user-centric feature that allows customers to freeze or unfreeze their virtual cards at any time via our mobile application, with strong attention to security, usability, and cross-system synchronization.

Scope of Requirement:

User Experience & Interface:

Integrate a “Freeze/Unfreeze Card” toggle within the existing mobile app card management screen for all eligible virtual cards.

Display clear UI feedback, showing the current status (Frozen/Active) with visual cues (color change, icon, status text).

If the freeze/unfreeze operation fails (e.g., due to backend or network issues), provide instant feedback and offer retry/cancel options.

Include context-sensitive help and tooltips to educate users about the implications of freezing a card (e.g., online purchases, subscriptions).

Backend Logic & Synchronization:

Implement RESTful endpoints to handle freeze/unfreeze requests, ensuring atomicity and idempotence of operations.

All changes must be instantly reflected in the card’s status across all systems (e.g., card processor, fraud monitoring, transaction authorization).

For cards in a “frozen” state, decline all new transaction authorization requests except for whitelisted exceptions (e.g., merchant-initiated recurring payments, settlement adjustments).

Ensure freeze/unfreeze actions are logged with timestamp, user/device metadata, and operation outcome for auditability.

Edge Case Handling:

If a user attempts to freeze or unfreeze a card during scheduled backend maintenance or API downtime, the system must queue the request and notify the user.

In scenarios where freeze/unfreeze fails on third-party processor systems, roll back the change and inform the user with actionable next steps.

Prevent conflicting requests (e.g., multiple freeze/unfreeze toggles within a short period) by locking the state and alerting the user.

Security & Compliance:

Require strong user authentication (biometrics, PIN, or multi-factor) prior to freeze/unfreeze actions.

Ensure all API calls and logs related to this feature are encrypted end-to-end.

Maintain compliance with applicable payment network and regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, SOC 2).

Operational Support:

Provide customer support teams with real-time status visibility and override tools for exceptional cases.

Integrate new events and status changes with existing notification channels (push, SMS, email).

Documentation & Rollout:

Update user guides, help center articles, and in-app messaging.

Pilot feature with select user cohorts before general release, collecting feedback and iterating as needed.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires coordination with card processor APIs and existing transaction authorization systems.

Feature must support rollback for failed requests to prevent “stuck” cards.

Performance benchmarks must meet existing mobile app standards.

Deliverables:

Updated app UI and backend endpoints

End-to-end process documentation

Test cases and QA plan

Go-live checklist and support scripts
