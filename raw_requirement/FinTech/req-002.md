FT-002: Minor Onboarding with Guardian KYC
Title:
Digital Onboarding Workflow for Minors with Guardian KYC Fallback

Background & Objective:
The platform seeks to expand its customer base by enabling digital account onboarding for minors (individuals under 18 years of age) in accordance with regulatory and compliance standards. Given legal restrictions on collecting personally identifiable information (PII) from minors, a guardian-based KYC (Know Your Customer) fallback process is required.

Requirement Details:

Workflow Design:

Implement a multi-step onboarding process where minors provide essential identity information but are not required to complete KYC themselves.

Prompt for the legal guardianâ€™s information at the relevant step and initiate the KYC process for the guardian.

Allow seamless hand-off between minor and guardian during onboarding, supporting device or session switches.

KYC Integration:

Integrate with third-party KYC verification providers to process guardian information in real-time.

If KYC fails or is pending, provide clear feedback and next steps to both minor and guardian users.

Edge Case Handling:

Support cases where the minor switches guardians mid-process; enforce proper KYC restart and log all events.

Prevent duplicate onboarding attempts by the same minor using unique identity checks.

Compliance & Security:

Ensure full compliance with regional child data protection regulations (e.g., COPPA, GDPR-K).

All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

Maintain an audit trail for all onboarding attempts, with special flags for minor-related records.

User Experience:

The workflow must be mobile-optimized and accessible.

Provide clear, jargon-free explanations of the process, especially in steps involving guardians.

Documentation:

Update user-facing onboarding documentation and support scripts for customer service representatives.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Guardian KYC providers must be certified and approved by Compliance.

The process must allow for future extension to support additional verification methods as regulations evolve.
