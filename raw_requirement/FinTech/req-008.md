FT-008: Automated Loan Eligibility for Gig Workers
Title:
Automated Loan Origination Workflow for Gig Economy Workers Using Platform API Data

Background & Objective:
Traditional credit assessment models often exclude gig economy workers who lack formal pay stubs or standard employment history, despite having steady income across multiple platforms. The goal of this requirement is to design and deploy a loan origination workflow that leverages platform API integrations to aggregate, verify, and assess the income of gig workers for personal loan eligibility. This enhancement supports financial inclusion goals and opens new revenue streams.

Scope of Requirement:

API Integrations:

Build and maintain integrations with major gig economy platforms (e.g., Uber, DoorDash, Upwork, Fiverr) to retrieve earnings data with user consent.

Support aggregation of income from multiple platforms and ensure normalization of data formats (e.g., different period cycles, currencies).

Eligibility Logic:

Define a dynamic set of eligibility rules for gig income, considering income volatility, recency, and consistency.

Allow rules to be adjusted via an admin portal for rapid response to market or regulatory changes.

Clearly handle edge cases, such as users with zero earnings in the last 30 days, or income in non-supported currencies.

KYC & Fraud Checks:

Require completion of standard KYC and AML screening for all applicants, with enhanced checks for identity and employment verification.

Implement fraud detection logic to flag artificially inflated income (e.g., self-generated or anomalous transactions).

User Experience:

Guide users through the data connection process, providing clear consent flows and feedback on successful/failed connections.

Display a summary of imported earnings and allow users to dispute or provide additional documentation.

Compliance & Security:

Comply with local lending regulations, privacy laws, and fair lending practices.

Secure all data transmissions and storage, using encryption and role-based access controls.

Monitoring & Reporting:

Provide dashboards for operations and compliance teams to monitor application volume, approval rates, and exception cases.

Log all API calls, eligibility checks, and manual interventions for audit purposes.

Edge Case Handling:

Users with income from unsupported platforms should receive clear next steps or alternative application routes.

Handle cases where platforms provide incomplete data, triggering manual review.

Dependencies & Constraints:

Requires legal agreements with gig economy platforms for data access.

Must coordinate with Credit Risk and Data Science for rule refinement and scoring logic.

The loan product must be clearly marketed as “gig income eligible.”

Deliverables:

Loan origination workflow UI/UX

API integrations and documentation

Eligibility engine with admin controls

Compliance, audit, and monitoring dashboards

Training guides for support and underwriting teams
